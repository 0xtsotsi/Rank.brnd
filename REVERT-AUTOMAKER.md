# Fix Attempt: Revert Automaker Changes

## What Was Changed
Recently committed files by Automaker system:
- `components/dashboard/publishing-status-card.tsx`
- `components/dashboard/publishing/loading.tsx`
- Other dashboard components and migration files

## Issue
These files might be conflicting with Rank.brnd's actual dashboard structure or creating build errors.

## Fix
Reverting all Automaker dashboard component changes to see if this resolves the build failure.

## Status
**Changes**: None yet - will confirm with user first

**Reason**: Need to determine if Automaker changes are causing the Next.js config parsing errors.

---
**Waiting for user confirmation before reverting.**
