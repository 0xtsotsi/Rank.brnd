Looking at the previous context, I can see the Webflow adapter has been created. Let me check if the test completed and review the current state of the implementation.

🔧 Tool: Bash
Input: {
"command": "npx playwright test tests/webflow-adapter-verification.spec.ts --reporter=list 2>&1",
"description": "Run Webflow adapter verification test",
"timeout": 120000
}

🔧 Tool: TaskOutput
Input: {
"task_id": "b3ac958",
"block": true,
"timeout": 30000
}
