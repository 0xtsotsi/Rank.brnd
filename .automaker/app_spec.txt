Integration tests for API endpoints - test authentication, authorization, error cases, edge cases. E2E tests (Playwright) for critical paths - registration, login, article creation, publishing. Visual regression tests for UI components. Mock external APIs in tests. Aim for 80%+ coverage on business logic.</guideline>
    <guideline>GIT WORKFLOW: Feature branches from main. Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:). PR reviews required before merge. Squash and merge to keep history clean. Tag releases (v1.0.0, v1.1.0). CI/CD runs tests on every PR. Deploy main branch to production automatically after merge.</guideline>
    <guideline>DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS: README.md with setup instructions. API documentation via OpenAPI spec. Component documentation via Storybook. Inline JSDoc comments for complex functions. Architecture decision records (ADRs) for major technical decisions. Runbooks for deployment and common operations.</guideline>
